AI-Enabled IoT Health Monitoring System

This project is an **IoT-based smart health monitoring system** that continuously tracks vital body parameters such as **Heart Rate (BPM), Body Temperature, and SpO2 (Oxygen Level)**.  
The collected data is processed using **Machine Learning / AI** to analyze health condition and identify abnormalities in real-time.


🚀 Features

✔️ Continuous health monitoring  
✔️ Real-time data visualization  
✔️ Heart Rate, Temperature, and SpO2 detection  
✔️ AI-based health prediction  
✔️ Low-cost IoT hardware  
✔️ User-friendly interface  
✔️ Can be used remotely
